# Explore SQL with PostgreSQL

### Covered topics in Module 15

- What is Database?
  - A database is a structured collection of related data that represent some real world entities and are organized for efficiant retrival storage and management.
- What is Data?
  - Data is facts that can be recorded in the form of text, video, audio etc.

  - DBMS is a software which help us to manage database.
- RDBMS instruct by SQL
- Types of Database
  - Relational --> MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLLite, SQLServer
  - Document --> MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB
  - Key Value --> Redis
  - Graph database
- Different types of Database model
  - Hierarchical
  - Network
  - Relational
  - Document
  - Key Value
- Anatomy of a Table/Relation
  - Table --> Relation/Entities
  - Column --> Column/Attribute
  - Collection of column --> Degree
  - Row --> Rows/Tuples/Records
  - Collection of row --> Cardinality
- What is Key?

  2. Candidate key
  3. Alternate key
  4. Composite key

- In SDLC database is designed in system design phase.
- Relationship types in RDBMS
  - one-to-one (1:1)
  - one-to-many (1:N)
  - many-to-one (N:1)
  - many-to-many (N:N)
  - Optional one-to-one (0...1:0...1)
  - Optional one-to-many (0...1:N)
- Steps of database design
  1. Determining entities
  2. Determining attributes
  3. Relationship among entities or relationship cardinality
  4. If any many to many relationship heppen, we need to remove them any how.
